- Your Rationale: I generated a triadic color palette based on blue for my private messaging app due to blue demonstrating trustworthiness and tranquilly. Yellow and orange are the other colors that my triad is based on. Yellow represents optimism. The orange color is fun and eye-catching. That would be an appropriate combination of colors, creating a general positive vibe for the application's users.
